# Roblox Idler

Roblox kicks you after 20 minutes of inactivity.
To get around this, my son needs a program that moves your character at intervals lower than 20.
Given his interest in programming and dozens of Scratch projects, I thought this would be a fun project to work on together.

Initial Goals:
Build a program that takes an input for the value interval.
Input must be equal to or greater than 1 and less than or equal to 19.
Integer must be a whole number.
Interval will be in minutes.
At each interval, move forward, move backward, and jump/use action.
User must be able to start and stop the program.
A dialog pops up to confirm its running. Stop button can be placed here. Displaying total duration idle here would be nice.

Maybe Stretch Goals:
Users can set the input to whatever they want.
Multiple inputs at different intervals.
